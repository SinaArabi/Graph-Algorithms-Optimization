# Graph Algorithms & Optimization

This repository contains implementations of graph-based optimization algorithms. The focus is on solving optimization problems such as task assignment using the **Kuhn-Munkres** (Hungarian) algorithm and other related techniques.

## Project Overview

- **Kuhn-Munkres Algorithm**: Solves the task assignment problem, optimizing the assignment of tasks to processors with minimal cost.
